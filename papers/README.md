# Papers & References

Capture literature reviews, paper PDFs, and summaries. Suggested practice:
- One subfolder per paper with `summary.md` (include citation + key takeaways) and `tags.md`.
- Store `paper.pdf` only if licensing allows; otherwise link to the source/DOI.
- Track replication notes or follow-up experiments in a `notes.md` file.
