# Training & Experiments

Keep reproducible training pipelines, experiment configs, and notebooks here. Tips:
- Store configs (YAML/JSON) and small metrics artifacts; keep checkpoints in releases or cloud buckets.
- Log experiment intent/results in a short `notes.md` so the README generator can link to it.
- Prefer container/venv definitions (e.g., `environment.yml`, `requirements.txt`) for repeatability.
